# Conclusion:
# By analyzing the data, we can potentially observe:
# 1. The distribution of grocery items purchased (e.g., leans towards buying a small number of items at a time).
# 2. The most frequently purchased items (e.g., Milk, Apples, Bananas).
# 3. The correlation between the number of items purchased and the total cost (likely positive, indicating more items lead to a higher bill).
# 4. Average spending by category (if available, showing spending patterns across different grocery categories).

# These insights can inform decisions about product placement, promotions, inventory management, and understanding customer buying habits.
